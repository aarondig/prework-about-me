      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a journalism and design student attending The New School in New York. Currently taking a gap year due to a seismic shift in daily life that came without a seismic shift in tuition costs.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in San Francisco and lived in the Bay Area for most of my childhood, before moving to San Antonio, TX my sophomore year of high school.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Photography, Soccer, Hiking, Traveling.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Being a photojournalist for National Geographic or Time Magazine. However, a more realistic option is being a website designer or app developer that innovates new ways to present the news.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Temporarily living in Moraga, CA.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have always had a facination with design, and viewed myself as a visual-minded person. I believe learning frontend code will diversify my multimedia toolkit, and give me the ability to present visual narratives in cutting edge ways.
